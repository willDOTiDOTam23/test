          <h1>The Supercar Lexus Built When Nobody Was Looking</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            A carbon-fiber Lexus that revs to 9,000 rpm, makes 552 horsepower, and was limited
            to just 500 cars worldwide. If you want a normal supercar, there are easier
            options. If you want the one that feels like a luxury brand accidentally stumbled
            into a Formula 1 fever dream and decided to ship it, this is it.

          <h2>Carbon &amp; Craft</h2>
          <p>
            The LFA leans heavily on carbon fiber reinforced polymer, and Lexus developed its
            own carbon-fiber processes to do it in-house. The result is a cabin that is
            roughly 100 kg lighter than a comparable aluminum design and still tuned for
            high rigidity and feedback.

          <h2>The V10 That Thinks It’s a Race Bike</h2>
          <p>
            A 4.8L V10 with a 9,000 rpm redline, a rear transaxle, and lightning-fast
            automated sequential shifts. Yamaha treated the engine note like an instrument,
            so the sound you hear is the result of acoustic design, not happy accident.

          <h2>Nürburgring Package</h2>
          <p>
            Only 50 were built with the Nürburgring Package: 562 horsepower, quicker
            0.15-second shifts, and track-focused aero including a fixed rear wing. Lexus
            even bundled Nürburgring driving perks to match the attitude.
